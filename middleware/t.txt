Step 1: Data Collection
First, you need to collect data on the performance of different stocks over the last year. You can use a Python library like Pandas to collect and analyze the data.

Step 2: Data Analysis
Next, you will analyze the data to identify patterns and trends in the performance of different stocks. You can use visualization techniques like bar charts and line graphs to help you understand the data.

Step 3: Decision-making
Using the data you have collected and analyzed, you can use decision-making techniques to identify which stocks are the best investment opportunities. For example, you can use a decision tree algorithm to identify which stocks have the highest probability of generating a return on investment.

Step 4: Implementation
Finally, you can implement your decision-making algorithm in Python and use it to make investment recommendations based on the data you have collected and analyzed.

Here is an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how you can use decision-making techniques to analyze data:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load the data into a Pandas dataframe
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')

# Define the features and target variable
features = ['stock_price', 'market_cap', 'earnings_growth']
target = 'invest'

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_data = data.sample(frac=0.8, random_state=1)
test_data = data.drop(train_data.index)

# Create a decision tree classifier and train it on the training data
classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()
classifier.fit(train_data[features], train_data[target])

# Use the classifier to make predictions on the testing data
predictions = classifier.predict(test_data[features])

# Evaluate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = (predictions == test_data[target]).mean()
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
